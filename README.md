# 🏛️ Santorini Online

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After taking a **Graphical Computation** course and developing a growing interest in board games, I came across an online version of the game **Santorini**. However, I found that the website didn’t enforce the game’s rules—pieces were free to move anywhere on the board, which detracted from the strategy and experience. This frustration, combined with an inevitable childhood desire to develop games, sparked an idea: I decided it would be a fun and fulfilling challenge to create my own online version of **Santorini**, one that fully enforces the game rules and provides an enjoyable and seamless experience for players.

Unfortunately, due to a recent rework of the frontend and 3D rendering engine, the connection between the frontend and backend components is currently being redeveloped. As a result, there is no up-to-date video that showcases the current state of the project.

The previous video shown below demonstrates an earlier version of the frontend, but please note that it no longer reflects the current implementation, as the frontend governance was removed to support planned future features like ranking and competition.
