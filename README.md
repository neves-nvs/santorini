# üèõÔ∏è Santorini Online

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After taking a **Graphical Computation** course and developing a growing interest in board games, I came across an online version of the game **Santorini**. However, I found that the website didn‚Äôt enforce the game‚Äôs rules‚Äîpieces were free to move anywhere on the board, which detracted from the strategy and experience. This frustration, combined with an inevitable childhood desire to develop games, sparked an idea: I decided it would be a fun and fulfilling challenge to create my own online version of **Santorini**, one that fully enforces the game rules and provides an enjoyable and seamless experience for players.

## üöÄ About the Project

**Santorini Online** is a web-based version of the popular board game **Santorini**. This project brings the gameplay experience online, allowing users to compete against friends or AI, with full rule enforcement and game persistency. It‚Äôs designed to capture the strategy of the original board game while ensuring a seamless experience in the digital world.

> [!WARNING]
> Unfortunately, due to a recent rework of the frontend and 3D rendering engine, the connection between the frontend and backend components is currently being redeveloped. As a result, there is no up-to-date video that showcases the current state of the project.
>
> The previous video shown above demonstrates an earlier version of the frontend, as the frontend governance was removed to support planned future features like ranking and competition.

## üìÖ Roadmap (MVP)

- [x] User authentication and authorization
- [ ] Implement game persistency (database integration to save)
- [ ] Define and implement frontend graphical interface
  - Translate game state changes to 3D graphics
- [ ] Ensure full rule enforcement and game logic

## üìñ How to Play

In **Santorini**, the goal is to be the first player to move one of your workers onto the third level of a building. Players take turns moving one worker and building a block or dome.

### Basic Rules

1. **Move**: Move one of your workers to an adjacent space.
2. **Build**: After moving, build a block or dome in an adjacent space.
3. **Win**: If you can move one of your workers to the third level of a building, you win!

For a more detailed explanation of the rules, check out the [official Santorini rules](https://roxley.com/santorini).
